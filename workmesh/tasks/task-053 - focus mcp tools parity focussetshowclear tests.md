Definition of Done:
--------------------------------------------------
- Code/config committed.
- Docs updated if needed.

Notes:
- Added MCP tools focus_show/focus_set/focus_clear with parity tests (CLI/MCP). Tools read/write focus.json under backlog dir; focus_set infers project_id when docs/projects has a single project.
